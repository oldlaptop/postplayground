This is a simple, dumb Wapp (https://wapp.tcl.tk) application that does nothing
but log all requests it recieves to stdout, including the content of any POSTs,
intended for debugging purposes. Writing it and this README was faster than
finding whatever thing may already exist that does this job. A usual invocation
might be:

$ ./postplayground --server 8080

after making wapp.tcl available to [package require], perhaps by doing the moral
equivalent of:

$ cp /path/to/wapp/checkout/wapp.tcl /somewhere/in/tcl/modules/path/wapp-1.0.0.tm

Recalling of course that /somewhere/in/tcl/modules/path may be *added* to Tcl's
module path with something like:

$ export TCL8_6_TM_PATH=/somewhere/in/tcl/modules/path
